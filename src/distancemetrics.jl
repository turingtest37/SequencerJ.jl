"""
Constant to use when specifying the Square Euclidean or L2 distance metric for a sequencing run.

    The L2 metric measures the sum of squares of the Euclidean or Manhattan-style 
    distance between two vectors of values. Because it operates only on values and not 
    on their underlying grid or axis, the L2 metric is less sensitive to the positions of  
    values along their grid than the EMD and Energy metrics.
